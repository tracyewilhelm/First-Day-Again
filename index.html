    <p>I am a Colorado Native that enjoys the great outdoors, playing with yarn, sports, and hanging with friends and family. I am the Operations Manager for a small IT recruiting company, mom of three, and left fielder. I enjoy a good pun, puzzles, and food. I am currently working towards a career change into the world of software and web development. </p>
